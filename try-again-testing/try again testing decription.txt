STATUS: active, incomplete

for now this is complete. it's just a support document for my main game, Try Again. I tested out some cool inform 7 recursion and got the main mechanism for Try Again to work.

in the future, I may come back and make this more robust, so that it works for similarly recursive games of unspecified size.
