Try Again
An Interactive Fiction by Tulasi H
Release 1 / Serial number 200710 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

Cell
This room is depressingly familiar. You've paced across every inch of the cold gray concrete, stood on tiptoes to see out of the barred window, tossed and turned under the thin blanket on your cot. A small camera is embedded above the locked cell door on the north wall.

South Hall
The hall is flooded with red light and the sound of alarms. Your cell is one of many cells that branches off of it, and every door down the length of the hall is now open. To the south, you know there are branching hallways that lead deeper into this wing of the facility, and to the north is the main corridor that runs through the complex.

Intersection
Here, the narrow central hall of your cell's wing meets a wider corridor. The alarms are still blaring, and the light still dim, but you've been this way before (albeit under close supervision). The corridor runs from east to west, and though you can't see far in either direction, you don't hear or see anyone else.

Corridor (west)
A wider hall with an arched ceiling. This is where you pass through regularly to get to other parts of the facility, so despite the lack of light you can navigate it easily.

Alcove
This cramped room, if you can even call it that, overlooks the facility's yard. The sun set long ago, but the emergency lights on building exteriors illuminate it plenty. From here, you can see the east and west wings of the building, which face each other. Combined with the south wing, which you are in right now, the whole facility forms a U-shape. The yard is enclosed within this shape, and in its center stands the simple yet elegant control tower.

Leaning against the wall of the alcove is a hatchet, and the archway south of you leads back into the corridor.

Data Mining
This is where you've spent most of your out-of-cell time. Sleek white booths are installed around the perimeter of the room. All of them are locked shut; they are kept under tight control during off hours. cameras are embedded in each corner, and blink in the same familiar way as the one in your cell.

A spiral staircase leads up to a wide balcony that rings the room high above. You've only been to the second floor a few times, but you know there's an exit there that guards come and go from. Back on ground level, a heavy-looking door in the north wall marks another exit.

You can see a wooden door here.

Catwalk (Data Mining)
You stride quickly across the catwalk to the opposite side of the second floor, not bothering to look down. It continues to the northeast, entering an area outside of the data mining center. You keep following it until you reach a breathtaking view.

Here, the catwalk emerges from the wall of the facility, and connects to a great network of catwalks traversing the space above the central yard. The one you're on runs northeast, straight across the expanse to the facility's central control tower.

Turret
This small balcony is attached precariously to the catwalk, and houses a deadly-looking weapons system. It's turned off, but you've seen it used before when there's any sign of trouble in the yard. When the guards are having a good day, they'll set it to stun. The catwalk meets up with this platform on the east side.

Control Tower
This is it, the literal and metaphorical center of the facility. All polished glass and shiny metal, with catwalks jutting out at odd angles. The heavy door in front of you doesn't budge when you try it, but one seems to be standing slightly ajar a few floors below. No doubt the work of some hasty guard. It looks like there's a route down, if you drop from catwalk to catwalk without falling to your death.

Control Room
You've never been here before, but you know exactly where you are. Here, near the top of an intimidating tower at the center of the facility, is the control room. Even before you were locked up, these sparkling achievements of technological advancement were known to you; they are admired by many outside of the facility (and even some inside it).

As the door swings shut behind you, all ambient sound is abruptly cut off. The lack of blaring alarms is deafening. In the center of the room, an elaborate panel with neat rows of buttons, switches, and keypads provides more illumination than the emergency lights overhead. Attached to it, like an obscenely large laptop, is a screen wider than your armspan.

On the west and north walls are metal doors.

Alcove
This cramped room, if you can even call it that, overlooks the facility's yard. The sun set long ago, but the emergency lights on building exteriors illuminate it plenty. From here, you can see the east and west wings of the building, which face each other. Combined with the south wing, which you are in right now, the whole facility forms a U-shape. The yard is enclosed within this shape, and in its center stands the simple yet elegant control tower.

Leaning against the wall of the alcove is a hatchet, and the archway south of you leads back into the corridor.

Data Mining
This is where you've spent most of your out-of-cell time. Sleek white booths are installed around the perimeter of the room. All of them are locked shut; they are kept under tight control during off hours. cameras are embedded in each corner, and blink in the same familiar way as the one in your cell.

A spiral staircase leads up to a wide balcony that rings the room high above. You've only been to the second floor a few times, but you know there's an exit there that guards come and go from. Back on ground level, a heavy-looking door in the north wall marks another exit.

From a control room who knows where, you are assigned a task for the next few hours. When you're lucky, you might be categorizing images of road signs or transcribing handwritten diary entries. When you're unlucky... well, it's no good to dwell on the videos that have been etched into your conscience from those screens. You already see them when you try to sleep at night.

Vehicle Bay
You step tentatively through the doorway. This is a vast covered parking lot, dotted with plug-in spots for cars. Family and friends arrive here when they have scheduled visitations with prisoners. You scan the area, stomach slowly sinking further and further as you confirm the worst: there are no vehicles that you could use to make a getaway.

Then, over the sound of the alarms, you hear an engine roar growing louder. A headlight precedes a motorcycle, and then another, and then another.

"Hey, look!" a voice echoes around the lot, and before you know it the motorcycles are in front of you, three guards are dismounting, and you're being wrestled to the ground.

A pins-and-needles feeling envelopes you, and your vision goes dark.

Alcove
This cramped room, if you can even call it that, overlooks the facility's yard. The sun set long ago, but the emergency lights on building exteriors illuminate it plenty. From here, you can see the east and west wings of the building, which face each other. Combined with the south wing, which you are in right now, the whole facility forms a U-shape. The yard is enclosed within this shape, and in its center stands the simple yet elegant control tower.

Leaning against the wall of the alcove is a hatchet, and the archway south of you leads back into the corridor.

You stride quickly across the catwalk to the opposite side of the second floor, not bothering to look down. It continues to the northeast, entering an area outside of the data mining center. You keep following it until you reach a breathtaking view.

Here, the catwalk emerges from the wall of the facility, and connects to a great network of catwalks traversing the space above the central yard. The one you're on runs northeast, straight across the expanse to the facility's central control tower.

Chapel
You haven't been religious in a long time. During timeslots when most other prisoners are attending services, you angle for the better-paying data mine positions. It never hurts to have some extra credits on hand for unplanned phone calls or dessert at the mess hall.

Today though, despite the simplicity of the building, its underwhelming non-denominational altar, and the red light bathing everything, you feel comforted. You sit in a pew near the front, aware that you might never find your way out of this place. Rage is replaced by a hollow calmness.

You barely notice the main doors to the chapel slam open behind you, and you sit stoically as bright lights strobe over the room and guards stream in, holding down the perimeter. Someone grabs your arms and drags you backwards.

A pins-and-needles feeling envelopes you, and your vision goes dark.

Freedom
You ascend out of the tunnel and are overcome with emotion. This is it. The first air you've breathed outside the prison for years. Above, a few stars poke through gloomy clouds. Behind you, tall concrete walls obscure all of the prison except the control tower, which rises elegantly upward. Ahead, a few sets of barely visible tire tracks cut through scraggly grass, and a grove of trees stands in silhouette in the distance.

Before you take your first step out of the stairway and onto firm ground, you're blinded by a spotlight from above. Squinting, and ears still ringing from the emergency alarms, you see a helicopter hovering overhead, eerily silent. As your eyes adjust, two trucks barrel toward you. Guards leap out, their boots crunching over grass which is sharply illuminated in a circle around you. Gloved hands grab your arms.

A pins-and-needles feeling envelopes you, and your vision goes dark.

Trackway (south)
Here, a small platform sits at the side of an indoor tunnel. tracks for the security cars extend north. This system loops around the facility, and guards can access most important rooms from it; right now the tracks are safe to walk on, as the cars only run at certain hours.

Vehicle Bay
You step tentatively through the doorway. This is a vast covered parking lot, dotted with plug-in spots for cars. Family and friends arrive here when they have scheduled visitations with prisoners. You scan the area, stomach slowly sinking further and further as you confirm the worst: there are no vehicles that you could use to make a getaway.

Then, over the sound of the alarms, you hear an engine roar growing louder. A headlight precedes a motorcycle, and then another, and then another.

"Hey, look!" a voice echoes around the lot, and before you know it the motorcycles are in front of you, three guards are dismounting, and you're being wrestled to the ground.

A pins-and-needles feeling envelopes you, and your vision goes dark.

Here, the narrow central hall of your cell's wing meets a wider corridor. The alarms are still blaring, and the light still dim, but you've been this way before (albeit under close supervision). The corridor runs from east to west, and though you can't see far in either direction, you don't hear or see anyone else.

The pane is dotted with two-way speakers, separated by plastic dividers for a measly amount of privacy.

A door at the southeast, with a check-in machine next to it, leads to the phone bank (which is much more familiar to you than visitation). And although it's normally locked, the door in the glass divider hangs open, giving you access to two more doors on the northeast and northwest walls.

You stand against the facility wall, staying out of the better-lit yard area.

This section is fenced off, but you could definitely climb the chain-link to the west. Beyond that, it would be a clean dash to the main entrance of the facility. Now you just have to step away from the wall.

The room is bright and expansive, lined wall-to-wall with server stacks. Its sole occupant, a disheveled late-shift worker, is sitting between the stacks taking a nap. A pleasant chime from the overhead speakers jolts him awake.

"Done already? Good girl," he mutters, patting the nearest machine. He scratches his mostly bald head, then makes his way to a desk in one corner.

Sitting in front of a portly computer, he drags a new file labeled "Power Outage" to the "Simulations" folder. Briefly consulting a to-do list, he searches through the computer with rapid keystrokes, then hits enter with a bit of flair.

"Earthquake simulation initialized," a pleasant robotic voice says over the speakers. The man plods back to the stacks and resumes his nap.

You've never been here before, but you know exactly where you are. Here, near the top of an intimidating tower at the center of the facility, is the control room. Even before you were locked up, these sparkling achievements of technological advancement were known to you; they are admired by many outside of the facility (and even some inside it).

As the door swings shut behind you, all ambient sound is abruptly cut off. The lack of blaring alarms is deafening. In the center of the room, an elaborate panel with neat rows of buttons, switches, and keypads provides more illumination than the emergency lights overhead. Attached to it, like an obscenely large laptop, is a screen wider than your armspan.

On the west and north walls are metal doors.

Secret Tunnel
For a while longer, you walk east. You don't know where this tunnel leads, or what your fate will be when you get there. Lost in musings, and no longer feeling hurried, you don't see the ladder until you're practically right in front of it. The ladder goes upward.

Freedom
You ascend out of the tunnel and are overcome with emotion. This is it. The first air you've breathed outside the prison for years. Above, a few stars poke through gloomy clouds. Behind you, tall concrete walls obscure all of the prison except the control tower, which rises elegantly upward. Ahead, a few sets of barely visible tire tracks cut through scraggly grass, and a grove of trees stands in silhouette in the distance.

Before you take your first step out of the stairway and onto firm ground, you're blinded by a spotlight from above. Squinting, and ears still ringing from the emergency alarms, you see a helicopter hovering overhead, eerily silent. As your eyes adjust, two trucks barrel toward you. Guards leap out, their boots crunching over grass which is sharply illuminated in a circle around you. Gloved hands grab your arms.

A pins-and-needles feeling envelopes you, and your vision goes dark.

You've never been here before, but you know exactly where you are. Here, near the top of an intimidating tower at the center of the facility, is the control room. Even before you were locked up, these sparkling achievements of technological advancement were known to you; they are admired by many outside of the facility (and even some inside it).

As the door swings shut behind you, all ambient sound is abruptly cut off. The lack of blaring alarms is deafening. In the center of the room, an elaborate panel with neat rows of buttons, switches, and keypads provides more illumination than the emergency lights overhead. Attached to it, like an obscenely large laptop, is a screen wider than your armspan.

On the west and north walls are metal doors.

Chapel
You haven't been religious in a long time. During timeslots when most other prisoners are attending services, you angle for the better-paying data mine positions. It never hurts to have some extra credits on hand for unplanned phone calls or dessert at the mess hall.

Today though, despite the simplicity of the building, its underwhelming non-denominational altar, and the red light bathing everything, you feel comforted. You sit in a pew near the front, aware that you might never find your way out of this place. Rage is replaced by a hollow calmness.

You barely notice the main doors to the chapel slam open behind you, and you sit stoically as bright lights strobe over the room and guards stream in, holding down the perimeter. Someone grabs your arms and drags you backwards.

A pins-and-needles feeling envelopes you, and your vision goes dark.

Although it's as cold and empty as the rest of the facility right now, and looks foreboding under the red light, this room is the only one that can be downright joyous at times. Here, you can greet friends and family, even if the pane of polished glass bisecting the room prevents real contact. The pane is dotted with two-way speakers, separated by plastic dividers for a measly amount of privacy.

A door at the southeast, with a check-in machine next to it, leads to the phone bank (which is much more familiar to you than visitation). And although it's normally locked, the door in the glass divider hangs open, giving you access to two more doors on the northeast and northwest walls.

The lights here are so far overhead and so sparse that the room is barely navigable. It seems very quiet and still, other than the constant alarms, and the various machines that generate power for the facility don't seem to be functioning. It confirms what you thought from the beginning: this must be a power outage. There are doors to the northeast and west.

Yard (east)
The facility yard. This is where recreation takes place, though you haven't come through the main entrance for prisoners. Usually, the amount of credits you'd need to spend on rec slots is infuriating, but tonight the breath of fresh air is free. You stand against the facility wall, staying out of the better-lit yard area.

This section is fenced off, but you could definitely climb the chain-link to the west. Beyond that, it would be a clean dash to the main entrance of the facility. Now you just have to step away from the wall.

Yard (west)
Heart pounding, you dash away from the relative cover of the wall. You reach the chain-link fence that partitions the yard and start climbing easily enough. You're only halfway up when a floodlight turns on, and you instinctively shield your eyes.

Rapid footsteps thud toward you from several directions. By the time you lower your hand, guards are yanking you down and you land painfully on the ground. Heavy boots fill your field of vision.

A pins-and-needles feeling envelopes you, and your vision goes dark.

This room is depressingly familiar. You've paced across every inch of the cool gray concrete, stood on tiptoes to see out of the barred window, tossed and turned under the thin blankets on your cot. Perched above the locked door on the cell's north wall, a small camera is embedded in the wall.

Just as your eyes begin to adjust, an eerie red emergency light fades up. The dim light confirms what you heard and felt: the door is open. Above it, the camera blinks back on, and glimmers tauntingly as you stare at it.
